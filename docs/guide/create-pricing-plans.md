# Create Pricing Plans

Plans are the instructions that assign prices to your products and usage metrics. Create a new plan for every flat recurring fee you want to include in your pricing.

Plans are composed of a few base features and additional **Plan Components**.

To define a plan you must define these fields:

- An interval of either weekly, monthly or yearly

  - defines the billing cycle for when customers on the plan will get invoiced

- A name

- A flat subscription rate

- A description (optional)

- Plan Components (optional)

Currently, each customer can only be on one plan, i.e only has one subscription.

## Plan Components

Plan components associate billable metrics or feature access to a given plan.
