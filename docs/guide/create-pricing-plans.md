# Create Pricing Plans

Plans are what assign prices to your products and usage metrics.

Plans are composed of a few base features and additional **Plan Components**.

To define a plan you must define these fields:

- An interval of either weekly, monthly or yearly

  - defines the billing cycle for when customers on the plan will get invoiced

- A name

- A flat subscription rate

- A description (optional)

Next you can attatch **Plan Components** to include usage-based pricing.
