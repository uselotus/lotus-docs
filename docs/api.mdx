# API Reference

## Getting Started

You can access Lotus's API directly or through the [SDKs](./api/node-guide.md) we have built.

Your api key obtained in the Lotus Frontend Settings tab, is only visible once your create it and, therefore, must be stored securily. If you create a new API key it, your **old API key will be revoked** and it will not authenticate endpoints.

### How to use your API key

The api key must be passed into the _X-API-KEY_ header like so:

```jsx
const headers = {
    X-API-KEY: LOTUS_API_KEY
}
```

<ApiDocMdx id="" />
